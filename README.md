# CV-WaterShed-Algorithm
Implementation of Watershed Algorithm using Python

# About
Image Segmentation is the process of dividing the image into multiple segments. The goal of segmentation is to change the representation of an image so that it can be analysed with ease. Mainly used to locate objects and their boundaries. Watershed Algorithm is a Region Based Segmentation algorithm. Here the image is treated as a topographical landscape with ridges and valleys. The elevations of landscape are typically defined by grey values of the pixels. This method is susceptible to noise and other irregularities and may give over segmented results.
